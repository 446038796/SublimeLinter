SublimeLinter 4.0 Pre-Release
===========================================

New features
-------------------------------------------

- Hover over an error to view the message.
- Hover over the gutter to view all error messages for that line.
- The statusbar now shows error (E) and warning (W) counts if there are any.
- The statusbar shows the error for your cursor position instead of all errors
  for that line.
- A panel displays errors in all open files.
- The panel can be filtered to just show specific types or severity level.
- Built-in next/prev_results can be used to navigate to all errors.
- The filtering also applies to these navigation commands.
- A new "styles" setting to configure error highlighting.
- Each linter setting now accepts such a "styles" setting, so colors, icons and
  highlight style can be differentiated per linter.
- Styles also have a "priority" which decides what icon to show in the gutter.
- Gutter themes can now be set using just their name.
- Generated "(SL)" color schemes are now hidden.

On Sublime Text 3 builds > 3149 (dev builds):
- No "(SL)" color scheme files are generated.
- Select a color by specifying "region.<colorish>" in the scope option. Colors:
  redish, orangish, yellowish, greenish, bluish, purplish, pinkish
- It's also possible to use any other color by specifying any scope that's in
  your color scheme (e.g. "entity.name")


Changes to commands, menus and key bindings
-------------------------------------------

The context menu now only lists the Lint This View command.
The tools menu has been removed.
Commands are now named sublime_linter_* to comply with naming conventions.
The built-in "next_result" and "prev_result" commands can be used to navigate
to errors, so the SublimeLinter-specific key bindings have been dropped.

Commands to change settings or toggle linters have been removed.
- Settings can be changed by modifying your user settings.
- Linters may be disabled in the user settings, in .sublimelinterrc files, or
  in your project configuration. Or you can disable each specific plugin with
  Package Control.


Changes to settings
-------------------------------------------

Default settings now have documentation in line.
Default settings can no longer be edited.
Default settings are no longer copied to the user settings.
- Learn about the configuration options for each linter in the docs and
  in the README of the linter plugin.

The "user" node has been removed from settings.

The settings "ignore_matches" and "demote_to_warning_matches" have been removed.
Your linter should have settings to modify the rules or severity levels.

The new output panel and filtering have supplanted the "make_warnings_passive"
and "show_errors_on_save" features.


How to upgrade
-------------------------------

Your old settings will be backed up to SublimeLinter old.sublime-settings.
You may want to compare them to the new settings and check if you want to
migrate anything.

To migrate your settings, first remove the "user" level and un-indent/flatten
everything a level. Check the default settings on the left to remove
settings that don't exist anymore:
- mark_style
- error_color
- gutter_theme_excludes
- mark_style
- passive_warnings
- show_errors_on_save
- tooltip_fontsize, tooltip_theme, tooltip_theme_excludes, tooltips
- warning_color

Please remove your existing gutter_theme setting and check the defaults for the
new options.

You can keep the "linters" settings block if it contains customizations that
you need. It's also safe to remove it otherwise.
