SublimeLinter 4.0.next
======================

- Did you see the settings `highlights.`? We have a new one: `highlights.demote_scope`. Set it to the empty string to 
  actually hide regions while editing. Set it to a Sublime scope to change their appearance. E.g. use `'comment'` to draw 
  them in soft gray.
