SublimeLinter 4.0.next
======================

Introduces a setting to show the output panel if there are problems:

"show_panel_on_save"

- Set to "window" to check if the window has problems.
- Set to "view" to only check the current file.
- Set to "never" to disable this feature. This is the default


Deprecations:
- The panel can no longer be filtered. The filtering had several problems
  and not a lot of usage. We will need to rethink this feature if there
  does appear to be demand for it.
