SublimeLinter 4.0 Pre-Release 9.9.2
===========================================

There is a new linter setting, "env", allowing you to set environment variables.

Renamed setting "chdir" to "working_dir".
The new default is "${folder:$file_path}", which means it chooses the project
root if available, and falls back to use the directory of the file you're
currently editing.
